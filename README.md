# Voice Assistant with LLM, Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech

This project is a Python-based voice assistant that listens to the user's voice, converts it to text, generates a response using a Language Model (LLM), and replies using Text-to-Speech (TTS). This interactive assistant integrates speech recognition, natural language processing, and audio playback to facilitate a seamless voice-based interaction.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Listens to the userâ€™s input and transcribes speech to text.
- **Language Model Response**: Generates responses using the Ollama API LLM model.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the LLM's response to audio and plays it back to the user.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
- **Ollama API**: An Ollama account and access to models compatible with the Ollama API.
